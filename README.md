# shift-share
Replication package and code for "Quasi-Experimental Shift-Share Designs"
(Borusyak, Hull, and Jaravel 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01221)

This project includes the replication archive with all code and data necessary to replicate the results reported in the paper, described in detail in readme files in each of the subfolders. It's structured in three parts:
1) The Autor et al. (2013) application (produces Tables 1--4 and C1--C4 and Figure C1 of our paper)
2) The Bartik (1991) application (Table C5)
3) The Monte-Carlo simulation (Tables C6--C7)
We also include an updated version of the ssaggregate Stata command which constructs shock-level aggregates of the outcome and treatment variables. It can also be downloaded directly from ssc.

We appreciate all comments on the paper and code!
